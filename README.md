# Pet_Friend

## Created by: xhy, One King

## Foreword:

1. The folder includes .pyw files and example materials.  
2. In the example files, pet.png/gif, close_pet.png/gif, and icon.png can be replaced as desired. The icon is the system tray icon, pet.png/gif is the moving object in chase mode, and close_pet.png/gif is the default display image in fixed mode.  
3. Our capabilities are limited, and we may not be able to completely resolve all bugs found during testing. We apologize in advance!  
4. Basic instructions:  
	- 4.1 Right-click on the pet body to open the options menu.  
	- 4.2 Right-click on the system tray icon in the bottom right corner to also open the options menu. The exit option is located in the tray's right-click menu.  

## Version 1.5 Update (Langent Edition)  

1. This update fixes some known bugs.  
2. The team is dedicated to enhancing the Agent's capabilities. We have revamped the Agent system from the previous version based on LangChain and are open-sourcing the related code, allowing users to build personalized Agents based on their own local knowledge base.  
3. Future version preview:  
  - 3.1 Based on user feedback, we are considering expanding interactive features.  
  - 3.2 The fun and aesthetic appeal of pet themes will also be taken into consideration.  
  - 3.3 The possibility of multi-Agent collaboration: Considering that a single Agent may experience functional confusion, the team is working on a LangGraph development workflow.  

## Version 1.4 Update (Agent Edition)  

1. Added Agent invocation methods, so our pet is no longer just a decorative item but a desktop companion with professional knowledge.  
2. Parameter paths are now configurable.  
3. Starting from this version, we are renaming it to Pgent, meaning Pet Agent.  

## Version 1.3 Update (Flying Pig Edition)  

1. Replaced the original static images with gifs, supporting extensions.  
2. The icon file is now packaged separately, supporting custom system tray icons (you can even use WeChat's icon, but I hope they don't send me a lawyer's letter).  
3. The example gif in this version is a flying pig.  
4. This program is completely free! Anyone charging for it is a dishonest scammer.  
5. In this version, the moonshot API belongs to the author. Please use the "Let's Chat Together (Beta)" feature responsibly, all beta testers.  
6. On Mac, there is an issue where the pet body may not switch positions as windows are switched. We aim to address this in future versions.  
Note: In future versions, we will merge the static image functionality from version 1.2 to achieve multimodal fortune attraction (just kidding).  

## Version 1.2 Update (Fortune Edition)  

1. Added differentiation between chase mode and fixed mode.  
2. Added large model API calls, so this program is no longer just a useless decorative item.  
3. Added options like Feed and Bathe (though they are currently non-functional) for potential future development (whether that development happens is another matter).  
4. The main character in this version is Fortune.
